We have a working chatbot example:
samples\streamlit-demo\streamlit-langchain.py

----------------------------------------------

1. Create a new project, git repo, uv and have the sample code running.
2. Update the sample code to be a RAG chatbot of your home town.
You two approaches here:
  - You can copy information from wiki into a .txt  or (pdf or .md) file and load it with langchain.
  - You can Scrape information directly from the wiki webpage (or other) and load the data using langchain.

-----------------------------------------------

3. Update your application to display the chunks/sources of information.

example is in samples\streamlit-demo\streamlit-source.py

-----------------------------------------------

4. Please update your 'knowledge base' of your home-town so that it would come from 3 different sources.
One of the source must be a file.

----------------------------------------------

5. This is your portfolio project and it should be visible in Github.
